I am a statistician and mathematician with research interests in Bayesian
inference, longitudinal and survival data analysis, mathematical
epidemiology, and network-based disease surveillance.

I am currently completing an M.S. in Mathematics at Tarleton State University
(GPA: 4.00), where my research focuses on network-based and network-free
surveillance strategies for infectious disease modeling. My work combines
stochastic epidemic modeling, Bayesian inference, and large-scale network
simulations to study early outbreak detection and optimal surveillance
design.

My broader interests include disease progression modeling, survival
analysis, and the application of statistical and mathematical methods to
public health problems, particularly in maternal and child health.
